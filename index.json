However, real-world deployment, especially in medical imaging, remains challenging due to unseen variations in scanners, patient demographics, and pathological conditions.\nTo address this issue, recent work has focused on foundation models: large-scale models pretrained on diverse data using self- or weakly supervised learning. CLIP-based models learn general-purpose representations that transfer well to downstream tasks. For the context of medical imaging, specific fine-tuned models such as MedSAM and BiomedCLIP demonstrate strong potential.\nHowever, adapting foundation models to new domains or tasks often remains challenging.

However, for real-world scenarios—including medical imaging and natural scenes—significant domain shifts caused by diverse data characteristics and scanner settings often prevent models from generalizing to unseen domains. To address this at the model level, domain adaptation and domain generalization have emerged as potential solutions. Domain adaptation relies on access to target data to learn target representations, while domain generalization aims to learn invariant representations and obtain robust models using only source domains. Recently, a new paradigm called test-time adaptation further optimizes the model during online inference on the target domain to boost performance.\nDespite these advancements, existing adaptation methods struggle with unique challenges in the target domain. These include class imbalance, category shifts within domains, reliance on unsupervised surrogate objectives, and non-i.i.d. assumptions that lead to error accumulation. Moreover, the scarcity of large annotated datasets limits the ability of models to learn meaningful representations for transfer. Recent studies also show that existing methods do not consistently improve performance in multi-source, real-world scenarios such as medical imaging.\nThis master’s thesis proposes new domain generalization and adaptation techniques to address these challenges. First, it will train models on multi-source data drawn from diverse distributions—different scanners, pathologies, and demographics. Next, it will explore existing domain generalization algorithms, analyzing the role of entropy minimization for optimizing model performance and the impact of feature alignment. Finally, it seeks to introduce novel contributions grounded in fundamental deep learning principles, with the goal of enhancing the adaptability and robustness of models across varied environments. The research outcomes are intended for publication in a relevant academic venue.\nThe start date ideally is June 2025.

Part of the problem arises from the 3D-to-2D projection process that can lead to out-of-plane motion, which impedes long-range pixel trajectory estimation. In the medical domain, video data, i.e. fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, can be used for guidance during treatment. Specifically, in radiation therapy, contouring algorithms are used for tracking of the target volume supposed to receive the main radiation dose during treatment. Delineation can, for example, be performed with a U-Net architecture. However, such an approach only allows for identification of larger structures, while irregular movement can be subtle and localized. Landmark detection models are able to identify such localized regions between different representations of the same object. Furthermore, they are faster than semantic segmentation models, and therefore, allow for computer aided intervention during treatment. In this thesis, different state-of-the-art landmark and pixel tracking algorithms will be tested and further enhanced to identify movement on temporal imaging data of the lungs, i.e. 4D CT. Furthermore, ability of such landmarks to identify movement differing from a normal state, i.e. allowing for identification of anomalies, will be studied.\n","date":1721865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721865600,"objectID":"b9bddca4db75fe418ddb6fbd44953b73","permalink":"https://compai-lab.io/vacancies/msc_tracking_lang_reithmeir/","publishdate":"2024-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vacancies/msc_tracking_lang_reithmeir/","section":"vacancies","summary":"Master Thesis.","tags":["completed"],"title":"Temporal Landmark Tracking on Medical Imaging","type":"vacancies"},{"authors":["Sameer Ambekar","Cosmin I.

Since the MR signal is acquired in frequency space, any motion of the imaged object leads to complex artefacts in the reconstructed image in addition to other MR imaging artefacts. Deep learning has been frequently proposed for motion correction at several stages of the reconstruction process. The wide range of MR acquisition sequences, anatomies and pathologies of interest, and motion patterns (rigid vs. deformable and random vs. regular) makes a comprehensive solution unlikely. To facilitate the transfer of ideas between different applications, this review provides a detailed overview of proposed methods for learning-based motion correction in MRI together with their common challenges and potentials. This review identifies differences and synergies in underlying data usage, architectures, training and evaluation strategies. We critically discuss general trends and outline future directions, with the aim to enhance interaction between different application areas and research fields.","tags":["motion correction","motion compensation","magnetic resonance imaging","deep learning"],"title":"Deep Learning for Retrospective Motion Correction in MRI: A Comprehensive Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hannah Eichhorn","Veronika Spieker","Cosmin I.

Because these annotations are time-consuming for the clinician to make, recent works focus on being able to limit the needs of annotation and still provide robust and reliable segmentation. Different strategies exist to overcome this limitation, such as transfer learning or self-supervised learning, which are learning prior knowledge on a similar annotated dataset or without any annotation.\nThe objective of this project is to be able to provide robust and reliable segmentation of a sparse annotated cardiac MR dataset.

Such data representations are analyzed according to their shapes which open a broad range of applications in machine learning, robotics, statistics and engineering. In particular, studying the shape of surfaces have become an important tool in biology and medical imaging. The extraction of appropriate data representations, such as triangulated surfaces, is crucial for the subsequent analysis. These surfaces are for example obtained from binary segmentations or 3D point clouds. Using standard methods, such surfaces are often not very accurate and require several post-processing steps, such as smoothing and simplifications. Deep learning based methods are of great interest in various fields such as medical imaging, com- puter vision, applied mathematics and are successfully used in the field of image segmentation. Gener- ally, a specific formulation requires a particular attention to representations, loss functions, probability models, optimization techniques, etc. This choice is very crucial due to the underlying geometry on the space of representations and constraints. we aim to develop a new set of automatic methods that can compute a triangulation and a normal field from a 3D dataset (binary image and/or 3D point cloud). The goal of this project is to understand the-state-of-the-art methods (e.g., [?]) and to propose solutions in the context of constructing a mesh from 3D images/point sets. We are interested in learn- ing from a dataset of smooth surfaces and their corresponding 3D datasets to make the triangulation or resampling accurate. The application will be the extraction of a smooth surfaces from μ-CT and CT data of the cochlea and inner ear, whose shapes can then be analyzed subsequently for population studies. To summarize, the key steps are : (i) Literature review and getting familiar with some state-of- the-art methods in the medical context; (ii) Implementing and testing the code before validation on real data; (iii) Optimizing the code and comparing with baseline methods. If successful, the method would be applied to analyze and classify surfaces.\n","date":1668988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668988800,"objectID":"c4b2d7ff1c9c70067764c166be8dacde","permalink":"https://compai-lab.io/vacancies/msc_surface_zimmer/","publishdate":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vacancies/msc_surface_zimmer/","section":"vacancies","summary":"Master Thesis.","tags":["completed"],"title":"Deep Learning for Smooth Surface and Normal Fields Reconstruction","type":"vacancies"},{"authors":["Cosmin I.

In general, the learned manifold is assumed to contain key information that is only important for describing samples within the training distribution, and that the reconstruction of outliers leads to high residual errors. However, recent work suggests that AEs are likely to be even better at reconstructing some types of OoD samples. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate what auto-encoders actually learn when they are posed to solve two different tasks. First, we propose two metrics based on the Fréchet inception distance (FID) and confidence scores of a trained classifier to assess whether AEs can learn the training distribution and reliably recognize samples from other domains. Second, we investigate whether AEs are able to synthesize normal images from samples with abnormal regions, on a more challenging lung pathology detection task. We have found that state-of-the-art (SOTA) AEs are either unable to constrain the latent manifold and allow reconstruction of abnormal patterns, or they are failing to accurately restore the inputs from their latent distribution, resulting in blurred or misaligned reconstructions. We propose novel deformable auto-encoders (MorphAEus) to learn perceptually aware global image priors and locally adapt their morphometry based on estimated dense deformation fields. We demonstrate superior performance over unsupervised methods in detecting OoD and pathology.","tags":["unsupervised outlier detection"],"title":"What do we learn?

However, this success is heavily dependent on the quality of the image that is being segmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis community is the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts due to organ motion, movement of the patient and/or image acquisition related issues. In this paper, we discuss the implications of image motion artefacts on cardiac MR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for jointly correcting for artefacts and segmenting the cardiac cavity. The method is based on our recently developed joint artefact detection and reconstruction method, which reconstructs high quality MR images from k-space using a joint loss function and essentially converts the artefact correction task to an under-sampled image reconstruction task by enforcing a data consistency term. In this paper, we propose to use a segmentation network coupled with this in an end-to-end framework. Our training optimises three different tasks: 1) image artefact detection, 2) artefact correction and 3) image segmentation. We train the reconstruction network to automatically correct for motion-related artefacts using synthetically corrupted cardiac MR k-space data and uncorrected reconstructed images. Using a test set of 500 2D+time cine MR acquisitions from the UK Biobank data set, we achieve demonstrably good image quality and high segmentation accuracy in the presence of synthetic motion artefacts. We showcase better performance compared to various image correction architectures.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning-Based Detection and Correction of Cardiac MR Motion Artefacts During Reconstruction for High-Quality Segmentation","type":"fpublications"},{"authors":["Daniel Rueckert","Julia A.

Quality assessment of medical images is therefore an essential activity and for large population studies such as the UK Biobank (UKBB), manual identification of artefacts such as those caused by unanticipated motion is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automatic image quality assessment techniques. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect the presence of motion-related artefacts in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images. We compare two deep learning architectures to classify poor quality CMR images: 1) 3D spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN), 2) Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). Though in real clinical setup motion artefacts are common, high-quality imaging of UKBB, which comprises cross-sectional population data of volunteers who do not necessarily have health problems creates a highly imbalanced classification problem. Due to the high number of good quality images compared to the relatively low number of images with motion artefacts, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme based on synthetic artefact creation in k-space. We also investigate a learning approach using a predetermined curriculum based on synthetic artefact severity. We evaluate our pipeline on a subset of the UK Biobank data set consisting of 3510 CMR images. The LRCN architecture outperformed the 3D-CNN architecture and was able to detect 2D+time short axis images with motion artefacts in less than 1ms with high recall. We compare our approach to a range of state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. The novel data augmentation and curriculum learning approaches both improved classification performance achieving overall area under the ROC curve of 0.89.","tags":["Cardiac MR motion artefacts","Image quality assessment","Artifact","Convolutional neural networks","LSTM"],"title":"Automatic CNN-based detection of cardiac MR motion artefacts using k-space data augmentation and curriculum learning","type":"fpublications"},{"authors":["Julia A.

While the original focus of image registration has predominantly been on correcting for rigid-body motion of brain image volumes acquired at different scanning sessions, often with different modalities, the advent of dedicated longitudinal and cross-sectional brain studies soon necessitated the development of more sophisticated methods that are able to detect and measure local structural or functional changes, or group differences. Moving outside of the brain, cine imaging and dynamic imaging required the development of deformable image registration to directly measure or compensate for local tissue motion. Since then, deformable image registration has become a general enabling technology. In this work we will present our own contributions to the state-of-the-art in deformable multi-modal fusion and complex motion modelling, and then discuss remaining challenges and provide future perspectives to the field.","tags":["Demons","Discrete optimization","Registration uncertainty","Sliding motion","Supervoxels","Multi-modality"],"title":"Advances and Challenges in Deformable Image Registration: From Image Fusion to Complex Motion Modelling","type":"fpublications"},{"authors":["Mattias P Heinrich","Mark Jenkinson","Manav Bhushan","Tahreema Matin","Fergus V Gleeson","Michael Brady","Julia A.

      <title>Multiparametric (TI-TE) MRI sequence adaptation and implicit neural representation (INR)-based reconstruction</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiparametric MRI sequences allow for the acquisition of images with varying tissue contrast
within a single scan. The resulting multiparametric images can be used to extract quantitative
information on tissue microstructure. To make such multiparametric sequences feasible for
clinical routine, the usually very long scan times need to be shortened e.g. through
undersampling in k-space. However, this comes with challenges for the reconstruction. In
general, advanced reconstruction techniques such as compressed sensing or deep learning-based approaches (1) can enable the acquisition of high-quality images despite the
acceleration. For multiparametric MRI sequences very high accelerations can be achieved by
leveraging redundant anatomical information e.g. through joint reconstruction with an implicit
neural representation (INR) network (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to extend an MPnRAGE (3) (multiple inversion times, TI) acquisition and
reconstruction framework by adding an echo time (TE) dimension. The first part of the project
will involve modifying the existing MPnRAGE sequence, including iterative improvements on the
scanner. The second part of the project will focus on adapting the INR-based reconstruction for
the multiparametric (TI-TE) data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The student will benefit from:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidance from both MRI and AI experts in a collaborative, interdisciplinary research
setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands on experience with the MRI scanner and coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunity to contribute to ongoing research and potential publication in medical
imaging journals or conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 year master thesis (such as in BEMP MSc).&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Multi-object and multi-modal image segmentation in dental MR using limited data</title>
      <link>https://compai-lab.io/vacancies/msc_lina_dental/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning methods have revolutionized the field of medical imaging, in particular image segmentation. Supervised methods, often based on the popular U-Net architecture, show state-of-the-art results in many medical applications. But a large annotated database for training is not always available. The objective of this project is to explore and develop methods for learning segmentations using limited data, e.g., using transfer [1], self-supervised [2,3] or meta learning [4–6]. This project is a collaboration between the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology (TUM), the Department of Periodontology (LMU) and the Chair of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (TUM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical application is the identification of periodontal lesions in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. The study aims at detecting intraosseous pathologies automatically. Periodontitis (chronic or acute alterations of the periodontium) is among the globally widest spread diseases, and interacts with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The diagnosis and monitoring of periodontitis is mainly based on imaging modalities exhibiting ionizing radiation: X-ray (panoramic radiography) and cone-beam CT. Recent studies report the successful use of MR imaging in the application of periodontitis diagnosis [7]. Two MRI sequences were developed: a T1-weighted sequence to visualise osseous tissue, and a T2-weighted sequence to visualise the periodontal lesion. To enable automatic diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, accurate segmentations of the bone and periodontal lesion are of utmost importance. A prior collaborative effort between the previously mentioned departments has already resulted in the development of an AI algorithm capable of differentiating between bone and nerve tissue in the mandibular bone. The subsequent objective is to automatically detect periodontal lesions within the bone. [8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospective student will explore existing deep-learning-based segmentation methods for training with limited data, to segment periodontal lesions in MR sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Prior experience and good understanding in machine learning and statistics.
• Very good programming skills in Python (and PyTorch).
• Interest in medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning from Many - Domain Generalization for Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning achieves good performance when training and test data share similar distribution characteristics. However, for real-world scenarios—including medical imaging and natural scenes—significant domain shifts caused by diverse data characteristics and scanner settings often prevent models from generalizing to unseen domains. To address this at the model level, domain adaptation and domain generalization have emerged as potential solutions. Domain adaptation relies on access to target data to learn target representations, while domain generalization aims to learn invariant representations and obtain robust models using only source domains. Recently, a new paradigm called test-time adaptation further optimizes the model during online inference on the target domain to boost performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these advancements, existing adaptation methods struggle with unique challenges in the target domain. These include class imbalance, category shifts within domains, reliance on unsupervised surrogate objectives, and non-i.i.d. assumptions that lead to error accumulation. Moreover, the scarcity of large annotated datasets limits the ability of models to learn meaningful representations for transfer. Recent studies also show that existing methods do not consistently improve performance in multi-source, real-world scenarios such as medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This master’s thesis proposes new domain generalization and adaptation techniques to address these challenges. First, it will train models on multi-source data drawn from diverse distributions—different scanners, pathologies, and demographics. Next, it will explore existing domain generalization algorithms, analyzing the role of entropy minimization for optimizing model performance and the impact of feature alignment. Finally, it seeks to introduce novel contributions grounded in fundamental deep learning principles, with the goal of enhancing the adaptability and robustness of models across varied environments. The research outcomes are intended for publication in a relevant academic venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start date ideally is June 2025. The thesis is offered by the Chair for Computational Imaging and AI in Medicine (Prof. Dr. Julia Schnabel) and supervised by Sameer Ambekar and Dr. Daniel Lang.

      <title>Multi-object and multi-modal image segmentation in dental MR using limited data</title>
      <link>https://compai-lab.io/vacancies/msc_lina_dental/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning methods have revolutionized the field of medical imaging, in particular image segmentation. Supervised methods, often based on the popular U-Net architecture, show state-of-the-art results in many medical applications. But a large annotated database for training is not always available. The objective of this project is to explore and develop methods for learning segmentations using limited data, e.g., using transfer [1], self-supervised [2,3] or meta learning [4–6]. This project is a collaboration between the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology (TUM), the Department of Periodontology (LMU) and the Chair of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (TUM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical application is the identification of periodontal lesions in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images. The study aims at detecting intraosseous pathologies automatically. Periodontitis (chronic or acute alterations of the periodontium) is among the globally widest spread diseases, and interacts with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The diagnosis and monitoring of periodontitis is mainly based on imaging modalities exhibiting ionizing radiation: X-ray (panoramic radiography) and cone-beam CT. Recent studies report the successful use of MR imaging in the application of periodontitis diagnosis [7]. Two MRI sequences were developed: a T1-weighted sequence to visualise osseous tissue, and a T2-weighted sequence to visualise the periodontal lesion. To enable automatic diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, accurate segmentations of the bone and periodontal lesion are of utmost importance. A prior collaborative effort between the previously mentioned departments has already resulted in the development of an AI algorithm capable of differentiating between bone and nerve tissue in the mandibular bone. The subsequent objective is to automatically detect periodontal lesions within the bone. [8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospective student will explore existing deep-learning-based segmentation methods for training with limited data, to segment periodontal lesions in MR sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Prior experience and good understanding in machine learning and statistics.
• Very good programming skills in Python (and PyTorch).
• Interest in medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contrastive Learning Strategies for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://compai-lab.io/vacancies/msc_contrastive_learning_maxime/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) overcomes the limitations of most learning methods, which require high-quality labelled data. Contrastive learning is a popular technique of SSL, where a model learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples by bringing similar data points closer and dissimilar ones farther apart in the feature space. A key element of contrastive learning is defining the positive and negative pairs, as the model learns by comparing these pairs to adjust its representation. Proper pair selection is crucial for the effectiveness of the learned embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to compare different strategies for defining pairs in contrastive learning for medical applications. The first part of the project will involve identifying and comparing state-of-the-art strategies on medical tasks. The second part will focus on evaluating and proposing new strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
